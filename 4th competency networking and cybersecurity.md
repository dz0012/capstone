## Networking and Cybersecurity Competency  
## Courses: CIDM 6340 Networking and CIDM 6341 Cybersecurity  

The Networking and Cybersecurity courses, CIDM 6340 and CIDM 6341, provided a comprehensive foundation in understanding how information systems are connected, secured, and managed in an increasingly digital world. Together, they bridged theory and practice by showing how network design directly influences security posture and how vulnerabilities can be mitigated through effective planning, technical tools, and risk management strategies.  

Throughout these courses, I developed practical skills using industry-standard tools such as ShieldsUP, Recuva, Refog,*Nessus, and Nmap. These exercises exposed me to multiple layers of digital defense, from port scanning and vulnerability testing to system monitoring and data recovery. In CIDM 6340, I learned how to create wireless network maps for new business setups and gained a deeper understanding of how topology and access points impact both performance and security. In CIDM 6341, I applied these concepts to develop contingency and incident response plans and performed full-scale security audits for two local businesses, BoomerJack’s Restaurant and Wiley X. These audits included evaluating their infrastructure, identifying weaknesses, and recommending specific improvements to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.  

Through these experiences, I realized that cybersecurity is not limited to technology alone. Non-technological assets such as physical security, employee awareness, and internal policies play equally critical roles. The overarching lesson was that any asset, digital or physical, with a single entry point capable of exposing sensitive information must be protected through layered defense strategies. This holistic approach reshaped how I think about both network and organizational security.  

These two courses gave me a crash course in what it truly takes to safeguard networks at both personal and enterprise levels. They have given me a much greater appreciation for how cybersecurity integrates into everyday life and business operations. I now understand how to not only protect my own home network and personal devices, but also how to plan for, prevent, and respond to potential breaches within larger organizations. One of the most valuable lessons was recognizing that cybersecurity is not just about preventing attacks—it’s also about planning for recovery and continuity. Learning to build contingency plans reinforced the importance of proactive strategies to minimize downtime and protect critical assets when incidents occur.  

From a professional standpoint, the competencies I developed in these courses have direct applications to my current career and future ambitions. In my role at Salesforce, the knowledge I gained enables me to better advise customers on how to structure and secure their networks, ensuring that their systems are resilient against modern threats. Beyond my current work, these experiences have also sparked an interest in offering cybersecurity consulting services to small and mid-sized businesses, helping them build secure IT environments and adopt efficient security practices.  

Throughout the semester, I applied these lessons in several hands-on ways. Using ShieldsUP, I performed port-scanning exercises to assess vulnerabilities and verify the security of networked devices. I developed contingency and recovery plans simulating how organizations could respond to data breaches or network disruptions. I also created full security audit reports for BoomerJack’s and Wiley X, offering detailed recommendations on asset protection, risk management, and recovery strategies. Tools like Nmap and Nessus helped me identify potential entry points and system weaknesses, while Recuva and Refog allowed me to practice recovering and monitoring sensitive data. Each assignment reinforced my understanding of how digital ecosystems function and how to safeguard them effectively.  

Overall, CIDM 6340 and CIDM 6341 transformed my understanding of both networking and cybersecurity. They taught me to think like both an engineer and a strategist, balancing technical defenses with procedural planning and human factors. These courses also deepened my respect for how critical security awareness is across every level of an organization. Whether managing personal assets, advising enterprise clients, or leading future teams, I now recognize that security is everyone’s responsibility. The skills and insights I gained have not only strengthened my technical literacy but also equipped me to contribute meaningfully to a world where cybersecurity is foundational to success and trust.
