## Overview  

The Software and Systems curriculum was one of the most transformative parts of my Master of Science in Computer Information Systems program. It pushed me to apply creativity and logic to build functional applications from scratch. Two courses were especially formative: CIDM 6303: Programming for Data Science and CIDM 6325: Web Application Development. Together, they provided a foundation in programming, system design, and full-stack development.  

 

## CIDM 6303: Programming for Data Science  

## Knowledge and Competencies Gained  

 

In CIDM 6303, I learned the fundamentals of Python and Pandas through DataCamp modules. As my first experience with programming, I quickly gained proficiency in data manipulation and scripting logic. Building on that foundation, I created a personal website using Streamlit, integrating Python code with CSS stylesheets to shape its design. This experience deepened my understanding of how the back-end and front-end interact within software systems.  

 

## Strengths and Weaknesses  

My greatest strength was the ability to adapt quickly and learn independently despite having no prior coding experience. My main weakness was debugging, as I initially struggled to identify and resolve errors efficiently. Over time, I improved by using Python documentation and developer forums, gaining patience and confidence in problem-solving.  

## Application and Reflection  

This course gave me a lasting appreciation for programming and automation. Even if I donâ€™t pursue software engineering, the skills gained allow me to collaborate more effectively with technical teams and understand how applications are structured. I plan to continue developing small automation projects to apply these skills within consulting and analytics contexts.  

 

## CIDM 6325: Web Application Development  

## Knowledge and Competencies Gained  

 

CIDM 6325 was both challenging and rewarding. I learned Django, a Python framework for web development, and built several projects, including a personal blog, e-commerce site, and student LMS system. These projects taught me the full software life cycle, from design to deployment and how models, views, and templates connect within a structured framework. I also gained experience integrating databases through Django, reinforcing earlier lessons from Data Management.  

 

## Strengths and Weaknesses  

My biggest strength was perseverance, staying committed through challenges that stretched my technical limits. My weakness was feeling at a disadvantage due to limited coding experience, particularly around routing, middleware, and relational queries. Overcoming these challenges required relying on Django documentation and tutorials, which built both understanding and confidence.  

 

## Application and Reflection  

This course reshaped how I view technology. I now recognize the logic and structure behind websites and applications and appreciate the complexity of web architecture. These skills enhance my ability to communicate with engineers, evaluate system design, and manage technology-driven projects.  

  

## Summary of Competencies and Preparedness  

Together, these courses strengthened my confidence in:  

Python programming for automation and development  

Framework integration with Streamlit and Django  

Front-end styling using CSS and templates  

Troubleshooting and debugging  

System architecture and database integration  

My next growth areas include improving advanced debugging, exploring cloud deployment and API integration, and enhancing my understanding of software scalability.  

  

## Integration Toward the Capstone  

Software and Systems integrate naturally with Data Analytics and Data Management by connecting analytical insights to practical applications. Python supports both data processing and web development, while database skills reinforce the logic behind Django projects. In the Capstone, I plan to demonstrate this integration through a prototype that merges data analytics with an interactive web interface, showcasing how code, data, and design converge to create business value.
