## Introduction

As a core competency highlighted within the program, Data Management provides the structure that enables reliable analysis, application development, and secure information systems. Through CIDM 6350: Data Mining and Management and CIDM 6355: Data Mining and Management, I advanced my knowledge in relational design, normalization, SQL, and database implementation. This reflection highlights the competencies I gained, the areas where I continue to grow, and my preparedness to apply Data Management in the capstone and beyond.



## Strengths and Skills Developed

In CIDM 6350, I designed a comprehensive Sales Leadership Database to model real-world business rules. The project required me to build an EERD capturing entities such as sales reps, leaders, mentors, territories, reviews, coaching sessions, and training modules. I normalized the design into third normal form, created ten interrelated tables in MySQL Workbench, and enforced referential integrity with primary and foreign keys. The final deliverable also included multiple SQL queries that supported leadership decisions; for example, measuring quota attainment by territory and tracking total coaching session time per rep. This project earned a perfect score and demonstrated my ability to transform business requirements into a scalable, normalized database structure.

In CIDM 6355, I strengthened my proficiency with complex SQL through exercises in joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions while applying constraints to maintain data integrity. To extend this coursework, I earned a DataCamp certification in Supervised Learning in R: Classification. This additional training reinforced how properly managed data underpins predictive modeling, and it gave me greater confidence in linking database management to advanced analytics.



## Weaknesses and Gaps

Despite these strengths, there are areas where I remain less confident. Query optimization techniques such as indexing and execution plan analysis require more practice. Database-level security and user permissions are also areas where I need to deepen my applied understanding. These gaps represent important next steps for working in enterprise-scale systems.



## Supporting Evidence

My applied work provides clear evidence of competency. The Sales Leadership Database includes a fully developed EERD, a normalized schema, and SQL scripts that created and populated interconnected tables. Given my trajectory in my personal career in education software sales, I built something that could be used in a real-world example. In addition, the DataCamp certification demonstrates my initiative to connect database management with supervised learning, showing that I can bridge foundational data management with forward-looking applications in analytics.





## Integration and Application

Data Management directly supports the other MSCIS competencies. Structured databases feed into Data Analytics by providing clean, reliable inputs for statistical modeling and visualization. Professionally, the skills I learned within this pillar translate into building models that will allow me to expand on my technology career into Solution Engineering.



## Conclusion

The Data Management competency has given me a solid foundation in relational modeling, SQL, and applied schema design. My final project illustrates the ability to apply course concepts to a practical business challenge, while the DataCamp certification highlights initiative to extend classroom learning into predictive modeling. Together, these experiences showcase both technical proficiency and readiness to continue developing expertise in optimization, automation, and cloud-based systems. As I move forward into the capstone, I am confident in my ability to design and manage the data structures that will serve as the backbone for more advanced applications and insights.
